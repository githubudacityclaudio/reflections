When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Certainly when working with others on the same project. That way everyone can work on their own local repository and push their changes to the remote repository. Also, a remote repository can function as an offsite backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

When I pull from a remote repository I am effectively merging a remote branch into a local branch. As with any merge this can result in conflicts. By pulling manually I can choose when I want to deal with potential conflicts instead of being interrupted while coding. If pulls where performed automatically there might even be conflicts with parts of a file I am working on right now. Resolving them makes no sense at that time. Even without conflicts changes by another developer might break my code, which he would be unaware of.
It would probably by quite confusing, too, when new code just pops up out of nowhere. I would have to interrupt my work to check incoming changes.
